The results are stored in the output folder.
The name of the file will itself tell what algorithm and neural network was used to create it.

We have included both the codes: with and without perceptual loss.

In the perceptual_loss folder we have not included the pretrained model due to size restriction.
So download it from:
https://storage.googleapis.com/audioset/vggish_model.ckpt
and put it in the folder before running
